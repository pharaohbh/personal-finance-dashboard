# Personal Finance Dashboard

This project is a 3-month personal finance analysis using a synthetic (fake but realistic) dataset.  
It demonstrates basic data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and dashboard building skills.

## 🧾 Project Overview

- **Goal:** Analyze 3 months of spending to understand where money goes and identify opportunities to save.
- **Time period:** September 2025 – November 2025
- **Tools used:** Google Sheets (or Excel), Pivot Tables, Charts

## 📂 Files in this Repository

- `personal_finance_dataset.csv` – transaction-level spending data
- `dashboard.xlsx` / `dashboard.pdf` – exported dashboard from Google Sheets
- `dashboard.png` – screenshot of the final dashboard (for quick viewing)

## 📊 Dataset Description

Each row in `personal_finance_dataset.csv` represents one transaction with:

- `Date` – transaction date  
- `Category` – one of: Food & Drinks, Transportation, Shopping, Personal Care  
- `Merchant` – place of spending (e.g., Jollibee, Shopee)  
- `Amount` – amount spent in Philippine pesos  
- `Payment Method` – Cash, GCash, or Debit Card  

The data is synthetic and was generated for portfolio purposes only.

## 🔍 Key Metrics (3 Months)

From the dashboard:

- **Total Expenses:** ≈ ₱93,692  
- **Highest Spending Category:** Shopping  
- **Total Transactions:** 200  
- **Average Spend per Day:** ≈ ₱1,171  

## 📈 Main Insights

- Shopping makes up the largest portion of total spending, followed by Personal Care.
- Monthly spending is relatively stable across September–November, with a slight decrease in November.
- Transportation spending is a small share of total expenses, suggesting most overspending is driven by discretionary categories (Shopping and Personal Care).

## ✅ What I Practiced

- Importing and cleaning a CSV file  
- Building pivot tables for:
  - Expense by category  
  - Monthly totals
- Creating pie and line charts for:
  - Category breakdown  
  - Monthly spending trend  
- Designing a simple, readable dashboard layout  
- Summarizing findings and interpreting results

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Add income data to calculate savings rate.
- Include budget vs. actual spending by month.
- Rebuild the dashboard in Power BI or Tableau.
